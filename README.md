### About
RADAR is a dynamic representation of peopleâ€™s impact on their environment. The piece uses time in context of a clock metaphor to communicate the relationship between human inhabitance and the stability of environmental measures. Using sound to measure disturbance, users can see how many minutes of the day have been filled with noise, and conversely, the tranquility of time without interruption. Conclusions can be also be made about how a disturbance in noise relates to other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and luminosity; without people these factors become irrelevant. Users can engage with the piece on the first and second levels of interaction principles, by either visually engaging or participating through their own contribution of disturbance. The cumulative sound minutes reset at midnight, and all other data is presented live.
